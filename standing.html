    <h2>ACADEMIC STANDING FOR DAY PROGRAM STUDENTS</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="block-text" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>
      Students are expected to work continuously toward their academic degrees.
      To maintain Good Academic Standing students must fulfill two requirements:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      1. Maintain a minimum cumulative GPA based on the following table:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Freshman: 	0-31 credits, 1.70 GPA <br>
      Sophomore: 	32-63 credits, 1.85 GPA <br>
      Junior:		64-95 credits, 2.00 GPA <br>
      Senior: 	96+ credits, 2.00 GPA <br>
      5th Year: 	140+ credits, 2.00 GPA <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      2. Achieve a minimum completion of 66% of the credits attempted in any given semester.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
      Good Academic Standing is not the same as Satisfactory Academic Progress for financial aid.
      Refer to the Financial Aid section for more information on financial aid eligibility.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Students in the Master of Architecture program must earn a grade of B or higher in all
      required architecture courses to be in good academic standing.

    <h2>Academic Warning</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="block-text" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>
      Students whose semester GPA does not meet the minimum GPA for their class in the chart above will be put on Academic Warning for the next academic semester. Academic Warnings are intended to make students aware that they are in jeopardy of falling into probationary status if improvements are not made.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block-text-title">
    <h2>Academic Probation</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="block-text" style="margin-bottom: 40px">
    <p>
      Students not meeting the criteria for Good Academic Standing will be put on Academic Probation for the next academic semester. A student who does not meet either of the two criteria for Good Academic Standing for a second successive semester will be academically dismissed from the Institute.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In addition, any day student who is put on probation for a second non-consecutive semester in their academic career at Wentworth may be subject to academic dismissal.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Students will be notified in writing that they have been academically dismissed at the conclusion of each semester. Students who have been academically dismissed may appeal the decision in writing to the Academic Appeals Committee in care of the Associate Provost for Academic Operations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Students on probation are encouraged to take advantage of the resources of the Institute including their academic advisor, The Learning Center, and the Counseling Center, to develop strategies for success in their academic life. Students on probation must meet all of the requirements outlined on the probation checklist.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Students who take classes at Wentworth (including Colleges of the Fenway courses) in a third (non-scheduled) semester for the purpose of improving their GPA may petition to have their probationary status reviewed following the posting of their final grades in the classes. Petitions should be addressed to the Office of the Provost in care of the Associate Provost for Academic Operations (please note that transfer credit grades are not factored into your GPA).
